# Tableau and SQL Analysis for COVID-19 Cases  

## Overview  
This project combines the power of SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization to analyze and present insights about the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data obtained from Kaggle, I explored trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases and created an interactive Tableau dashboard for a detailed visual representation.

## Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and exploration to uncover critical trends in the dataset.  
- Use SQL queries to analyze key patterns such as infection rates and regional impacts.  
- Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard for effective data visualization.  

## Tools & Technologies  
Data Sources: Kaggle  
Technologies Used:  
  - SQL for data exploration and trend analysis.  
  - Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preparation.  
  - Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard.
